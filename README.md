Helpful Code Snippets for the programming languages I use often
<br><br>

### Welcome to my Code References.
This a personal collection of notes for various programming languages that I use often. It is meant as a reference library for myself, but if you find any use in it, I am happy.

### I love forks (and knives and even some spoons as well)
If you find any errors, or an area where you would like to contribute, I am eager to accept pull requests. Bring 'em on!
