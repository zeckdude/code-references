| stub | Test stubs are functions (spies) with pre-programmed behavior. They support the full test spy API in addition to methods which can be used to alter the stubâ€™s behavior. As spies, stubs can be either anonymous, or wrap existing functions. When wrapping an existing function with a stub, the original function is not called. | https://sinonjs.org/releases/latest/stubs/ |
| spy | A piece of code that observes a method being called and can tell you information about what occurred (example: how many times it was called, what arguments it was called with, or what the response was) |
| mock | ??? | ??? |
