Bower is a package manager for web assets. It's incredibly useful for downloading common files such as `jQuery.js` and `normalize.css`.

1. Install Bower globally: `npm install -g bower`
2. Navigate to the project folder in Finder
3. For example, install jQuery: `bower install jquery`
4. Get the file location of each bower install: `bower list --paths`
