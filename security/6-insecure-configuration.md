## Insecure Configuration

Identifying insecure configuration is a strategy where hackers will find outdated software on the server and run exploits against them in order to gain access to the server. 

Conditions that need to be met in order for this exploit to work:
  * Lack of a standard hardening process for deployed infrastructure and software
  * No central account management mechanism in place on each server
  * No standardized and central process for patch management of servers, libraries or software
