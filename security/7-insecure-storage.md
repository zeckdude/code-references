## Insecure Storage

Identifying insecure storage is a strategy where hackers will find sensitive data (user information, passwords, credit card numbers) stored in a database in plain text. 

Conditions that need to be met in order for this exploit to work:
  * Storing of sensitive data in the database in plaintext or using a rudimentary encryption method
  
Ways to defend against this exploit:
  * Determine if any given data is absolutely necessary to be stored in the database
  * NEVER store any sensitive data in the database in plaintext
